                <li><strong>APJ Abdul Kalam,</strong> full name –<strong> Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul
                        Kalam</strong> – The Missile Man of India,
                    (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong).<strong> APJ Abdul Kalam
                    </strong>was a great
                    Indian scientist who worked miraculously for India’s missile Technology and nuclear weapons programs
                    and politician who played a leading role in the development of India. He served as a president of
                    India from 2002 to 2007.</li>

                <h3 id="cl-1 headline">Life of APJ Abdul Kalam:</h3>

                <li>After graduating from Madras Institute of Technology with a degree in aeronautical engineering,
                    Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1958. He joined the Indian
                    Space Research Organisation in 1969 as project director of the SLV-III, the country’s first
                    satellite launch vehicle. When he returned to the DRDO in 1982, he oversaw a programme that resulted
                    in a number of successful missiles, earning him the moniker Missile Man.</li>
               <li>From 1992 to 1997, Kalam was the defence minister’s scientific adviser, and from 1999 to 2001, he
                    was the government’s principal scientific adviser with the title of cabinet minister. Although the
                    tests raised worldwide alarm, Kalam’s important role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons testing
                    cemented India’s status as a nuclear power and elevated him as a national hero. In 1998, Kalam
                    proposed Technology Vision 2020, a statewide strategy that he described as a road map for converting
                    India from a developing to a developed society in 20 years. Increasing agricultural productivity,
                    prioritising technology as an engine for economic growth, and expanding access to health care and
                    education were among the goals outlined in the plan.</li>
              <li>Kalam was nominated by India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to succeed outgoing
                    President Kocheril Raman Narayanan in 2002. Despite being Muslim, Kalam was nominated by the Hindu
                    nationalist (Hindutva) NDA, and his status and popularity were such that the Indian National
                    Congress, the main opposition party, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election, and
                    in July 2002, he was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a purely ceremonial position. He was
                    succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first female president, when his term expired in 2007.

                   "My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently, courage to invent,
                    to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and to conquer the problems and
                    succeed. These are great qualities that they must work towards. This is my message to the young
                    people." </p>
